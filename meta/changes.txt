WARNING: Backwards compatibility breaks in this release.

Breaks
------

These breaks are generally to allow plain old PHP object (POPO) entity
classes.  This means that while one can use GenericEntity and extend it if
one likes, there is no requirement to do so.

- [BRK] Renamed "Record" and "Records" to "Entity" and "Entities" across the
  package. This is to keep it in line with changes to naming in other packages
  and libraries that use unit-of-work, identity maps, etc.

- [BRK] Remove GenericCollection::getIdentityValues() and appendNewRecord().

- [BRK] GenericEntity (previously GenericRecord) no longer tracks changes on
  itself. Use GenericType::getChangedFields($entity) instead. The new version
  checks **only** for changes to initial data, and does not report if fields
  have been added.

- [BRK] Entity\Builder (previously RecordBuilder) now sets field values by
  property (i.e., `$entity->field = $value`) instead of as an array passed to
  the constructor. This is to enable plain-old PHP object entity classes that
  do not depend on inherit GenericEntity (previously GenericRecord).
  
- [BRK] Entity\Builder now needs a Lazy\Builder.

- [BRK] Remove GenericEntity::$type and magic methods; moved methods to
  traits.

- [BRK] In GenericType, rename $relation to $relations

- [BRK] In GenericType, remove getRelationNames()


Other Changes
-------------

- [CHG] GenericType::load() now allows you to specify what field to use for
  the return values

- [CHG] GenericType no longer does lazy-loading of entities; it now builds
  each one at load() time.

- [REF] GenericCollection no longer uses a $type property.

- [ADD] Property Entity\Builder::$class, for extension purposes

- [NEW] Traits Lazy\MagicArrayAccessTrait and Lazy\MagicPropertyTrait to allow
  automatic replacement of Lazy placeholders for related entities and
  collections, along with magic get/set/isset/unset.  These traits can be used
  in any POPO entity class.

- [ADD] Methods GenericType::loadEntity() and loadCollection(); these return
  the newly-loaded data as an entity or collection object.

- [ADD] The GenericType, when creating an entity, now sets Lazy placeholders
  for related entity and collection objects.  The Lazy\Magic*Trait traits
  perform the replacement of the Lazy with the real entity or collection.

- [ADD] Method GenericType::getRelations() to get all relationship definitions.

- [CHG] Make the AbstractRelation object more explicit and a little dumber;
  move prep/checking from AbstractRelation to RelationBuilder
